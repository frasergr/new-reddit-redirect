# New Reddit Redirect

Dislike Reddit's old redesign but your friends keep linking the "old." URLs? New Reddit Redirect will ensure that you always load the new (reddit.com) design instead.

Will force all old.reddit.com usage to reddit.com. Will work when navigating to the site, opening links, using old bookmarks. Works regardless of whether you are logged in or not, and in incognito mode.
